Okay, so I need to figure out the answer to the question "the harm of sugar." Let me start by looking at the context provided.

First, there's a section about World Health Organization recommendations in 2015. It says that adults and children should reduce their free sugars below 10% of their total energy intake and encourage even lower levels for better health. This is part of a broader statement on reducing sugar to less than 5%. 

Then, there's another section discussing general health effects of high sugar consumption. It mentions that high sugar damages human health more than it provides nutritional benefits, specifically pointing out cardiometabolic issues.

Looking at the edit sections, I see some additional information about sugar industry funding and health info. The first edit is about Aaron, Daniel G., and Siegel's study on national health organizations, which shows that sugary drinks increase the risk of obesity by adding to energy intake. 

The second edit in that section talks about Schillinger et al.'s paper on sugar-sweetened beverages causing obesity and diabetes from their industry's perspective.

In another main article, there's a section titled "Diet and obesity ยง Sugar consumption" which states that excessive sugar intake increases the risk of obesity by adding to overall energy. It also notes that while sugar itself isn't a clear cause of obesity or metabolic syndrome, other factors like diet and genetics play roles.

Putting this all together, I can see that high sugar consumption is associated with several health issues, including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic conditions. The WHO's 2003 report supports this by linking sugary beverages to higher energy intake risks. Additionally, the meta-analysis in another WHO report shows that excessive sugar use increases diabetes risk.

So, the answer should cover both the general statement from WHO about high sugar causing more health issues than benefits and the specific sections on diet and obesity where sugar is mentioned as a factor.

High sugar consumption is associated with several health issues, including increased risk of obesity, diabetes, and metabolic conditions. The World Health Organization (WHO) reports that excessive intake of sugary drinks increases the risk of obesity by contributing to higher energy intake. A meta-analysis from 2016 further supports this, showing that sugary beverages are linked to metabolic syndrome and type 2 diabetes. Additionally, in a 2003 WHO report, it was noted that while sugar itself isn't a clear cause of these health issues, factors like diet and genetics play significant roles.

=====================================

High sugar consumption is associated with a significant risk of various health detriments, including cardiometabolic diseases.

### General Effects of High Sugar Consumption

Consuming high amounts of sugar damages human health more than it provides nutritional benefits. According to the World Health Organization (2015), adults and children should reduce their intake of free sugars to less than 10% of their total energy intake, with a goal of reducing it below 5%.

### Association with Cardiometabolic Diseases

High sugar consumption is linked to an increased risk of cardiometabolic diseases, such as obesity, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease.

### Sugar Industry Funding and Health Information

Research has shown that the sugar industry has funded studies that have downplayed the health risks associated with sugar consumption. A study published in The Annals of Internal Medicine (2016) found that the sugar industry had funded research that suggested sugar-sweetened beverages were not linked to obesity or diabetes, despite evidence to the contrary.

### Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses

Systematic reviews and meta-analyses have consistently shown that consuming high amounts of sugar is associated with an increased risk of weight gain, type 2 diabetes, and other health problems. For example, a systematic review published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition (2013) found that sugar-sweetened beverages were linked to weight gain in children and adults.

### Oral Health

Consuming high amounts of sugar has also been linked to an increased risk of oral health problems, such as tooth decay and gum disease. A systematic review published in the European Journal of Public Health (2021) found that sugar-sweetened beverages were associated with an increased risk of oral health problems.

In conclusion, consuming high amounts of sugar is associated with a significant risk of various health detriments, including cardiometabolic diseases, weight gain, and oral health problems.

Bot: The harm of sugar is significant and goes beyond just providing nutritional benefit. High sugar consumption damages human health more than it provides any nutritional value, particularly associated with a risk of cardiometabolic health detriments. This includes an increased risk for obesity, type 2 diabetes, heart disease, stroke, and other cardiovascular diseases. Additionally, there are concerns about the potential link between high sugar intake and cancer, although specific evidence is limited due to industry influence on research funding and information dissemination.
